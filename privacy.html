							<h2 class="privacy-info__title">The information we collect</h2>
							<p class="privacy-info__desc">
								User-Provided Information: We may collect personal identification information from users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when a user visits our site, registers for an account, places an order, subscribes to our newsletter, or fills out a form. We may also collect this information in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available on our Leselyx.ca. Users may be asked for, as appropriate, their name, email address, mailing address, phone number and credit card information. Users may, however, visit our Site anonymously, should they wish to not provide personal identification information. We will collect personal identification information from users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply personal identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain activities related to the site.
								Non-Personal Identification Information: We may collect data, which is data from which individual identifiers have been removed, during your use of the site.
